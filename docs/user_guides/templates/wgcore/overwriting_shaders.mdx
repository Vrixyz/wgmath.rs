:::note
The code described in this section can be run from the
[**overwriting_shaders.rs**](https://github.com/dimforge/wgmath/blob/main/crates/wgcore/examples/overwriting_shaders.rs) example with
`cargo run --features derive --example overwriting_shaders`. Complete source code is also provided at the
[end of this page](#complete-example).
:::

It is possible to replace the WGSL sources of any shader by another source file (assuming it exports the same symbols
and/or compute kernels). This can be useful in particular if you need to inject some special behavior into a particular
WGSL function, fix a bug, or improve performances, in a shader belonging to a dependency you donâ€™t have control over.
It can also be used to overwrite any embedded shader with a source file available separately from your executable (for
example if some of your game shaders are bundled in a separate assets directory).

Given a shader deriving the `Shader` trait with [`derive(Shader)`](./composing_shaders.mdx), overwriting its sources
only require a single line of code:

```rust
MyShader::set_wgsl_path("path/to/your/shader.wgsl");
```

Since this is static method, this will set the wgsl path globally. In order to take this change into account, any
compute pipeline that was constructed from this shader (or that depends directly or indirectly on this shader) have to
be re-created; subsequent calls to `Shader::from_device`, as well as any other function provided by the `Shader` trait,
will automatically take the new path into account. Typically, you would set this path before constructing any compute pipeline.

:::info
The shader at the path set with `set_wgsl_path` will **not** be embedded in the built executable or library. So be sure
that the path is always valid relative to wherever your executable will be run. Such shaders will typically be deployed
alongside the executable in a known path.
:::

All the overwritten shader paths are registered globally in
[`wgcore::shader::ShaderRegistry`](https://docs.rs/wgcore/latest/wgcore/shader/struct.ShaderRegistry.html).
This is essentially a hash-map between a shader type and its overwritten path. Another way to obtain the known path
for a shader is by calling `Shader::wgsl_path`.
